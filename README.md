# HitTheBox
A cross-plaform game made using the libgdx library in the Android Studio IDE. The objective is to react and click on the box 
as the box goes down the screen. Each time you hit the box, the box's speed increases. 

Here's some basic pseudo-code to understand the game.

1)initial box speed is 1.
2)if the box is hit, increase the speed by 2.
3)if you touch outside the box, initiate the game over command and wait for the try again button to be clicked

This game doesn't use different screens. All sounds used in the game were free for commercial purposes.
